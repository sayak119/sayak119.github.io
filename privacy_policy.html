						<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
			<p>Galexa discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Galexa’s behalf or to provide services available at Galexa’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Galexa will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Galexa discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Galexa believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Galexa, third parties or the public at large.</p>

We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Galexa takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
